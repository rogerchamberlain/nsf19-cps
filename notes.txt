NOTES:

The biggest issue we had in the last submission was the fact that the reviewers
did not see the mirror application as sufficiently general.

Possible foci for this year:

1. Multi-objective optimization - same goals as last year, but genaralize,
generalize, generalize.  Hidden Markov models, alternatives to MDPs, etc.

2. Safety - how to use imagery as a feedback mechanism for general safety
considerations.  This should explicilty include privacy concerns for
individuals who traverse the the field-of-view of the imaging systems.

The mirror project should be articulated as the experimental testbed.
